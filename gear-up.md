* Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.

I once was managing a colleague who had children in school. Allowing him to leave on time every day regardless of delays at work led to him being more productive. Implementing flexible start/end times were also effective at motivating people on our team.  He was a more reliable team member as a result.


* When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?

In a management setting: When someone is a serial complainer. It can be difficult to discern actual issues that I might be able to help alleviate. Reacting too empathetically too often can sometimes worsen their outlook, as they sometimes feel the need to ‘vent’ about everything going on in their world. 
Often a balance can be struck between an overly empathetic approach that encourages stopping work frequently to complain, and total indifference to their outlook. One where the team member feels somewhat content in their workplace, and work can continue unimpeded. 

  Often the above scenario is a result of some stressor or personal situation unrelated to the daily complaints, and can be addressed outside of the daily work flow (mediation, therapy, big workplace changes involving higher management, etc). Sometimes all that needs to happen is a change in their working conditions (bad desk mate, not feeling challenged, work going unappreciated, etc.).
