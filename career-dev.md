*What is your greatest strength and how do you know?

Problem Solving. I've used this daily at every job I've had the last 7 years. I have had numerous situations where problem solving had a critical role. I've been commended on being able to troubleshoot and solve problems. I've had to troubleshoot electrical communication systems for a while now. I use problem solving at work very often. 


*How do you work best?

I work best alone, but I still work well with team based projects. I like to go my own pace and not be slowed down or rushed by others. I prefer not to be distracted by issues unrelated to what I'm working on. I like to work alone, but I get along well in a team environment too. I'm most productive mid morning.


*What is your greatest area of improvement?

I need to improve my impulsivity. I often interrupt people and speak before thinking. I make impulsive decisions. I'm impulsive. I would say that impulsivity is my greatest area of improvement. I'm working to improve. 


*How do you hope to maximize your strengths for your new career in software development?

I hope to learn enough about coding to apply what I already know about problem solving and troubleshooting. With practice I hope to be as good at problem solving software as I am problem solving technical hardware problems. I hope to capitalize on my interpersonal skills as well. I'm good at dealing with people. I hope that I will be able to use these skills to my advantage. 


*How might knowing about your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?

It should help having strengths in problem solving, since that's a majority of what engineering entails. My preference of working alone will likely Not help me. I can't see a way that it would as most software endeavors are team based and often require you to wait on other members progress. Knowing my weaknesses will help me direct improvement. Knowing my strengths will help me direct workflow.
