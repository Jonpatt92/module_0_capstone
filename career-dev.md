What is your greatest strength and how do you know?

Problem Solving. I've used this daily at every job I've had the last 7 years. 


How do you work best?

I work best alone, but I still work well with team based projects. I like to go my own pace and not be slowed down or rushed by others. 


What is your greatest area of improvement?

I need to improve my impulsivity. I often interrupt people and speak before thinking. I'm working to improve. 


How do you hope to maximize your strengths for your new career in software development?

I hope to learn enough about coding to apply what I already know about problem solving and troubleshooting. With practice I hope to be as good at problem solving software as I am problem solving technical hardware problems.


How might knowing about your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer?

It should help having strengths in problem solving, since that's a majority of what engineering entails. My preference of working alone will likely Not help me. I can't see a way that it would as most software endeavors are team based and often require you to wait on other members progress.
